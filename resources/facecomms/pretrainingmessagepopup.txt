OK. You have now finished the test phase.
Now you need to collaborate with your partner.
On each trial, both of you will have the same faces in front of you.
The order of the faces is randomly jumbled up.
One of you will have a set of faces with one face that is selected in a box.
The other person will have a set of faces with numbers underneath each face.
Your task together is to complete it as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Important:

This part of the experiment is a "conversation" between you and your partner.
Unlike the previous session, you can speak as much as you want with your partner before you make a guess.

There is no time limit, but the faster you guess the more points you can get.

Each correct guess is worth 5 points, but each incorrect guess is worth -2 points.

You can only guess up to two times per trial.  If you reach 200 points, you can end the training early.

You must use forward slash ( / ) to enter guesses.  For example: /3 or /11
